# Translation Guide

This is just a translation guide when translating this Guide.


* Don't translate types. When it's a derivated type(like List or Record), please just translate if it can't be misunderstood translating back to english. Just an example: record can be translated to "registro" in portuguese, but "registro" can be translated back to registry or record, this leaves room for misunderstanding the translated term when reading a english text.

* Don't translate Modules and Functions. It can lead to not learning the language at all and that's not our intention, right?

* Don't translate Elm terms(like Elm Architecture or Time Traveling Debugger). Maybe put the translated version around parenthesis after the original term is used.

* Don't translate examples. There are repositories with the examples used in the Guide.

If you think more things need to be clarified in this document, please open a issue, let's discuss it.
