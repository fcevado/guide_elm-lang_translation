# Contributing

## New translations

* Create a issue to start a discussion about the translation.

* A person must take responsability for that translation(will be assigned to every PR related to that translation).

* Open a PR creating the translation folder(copied from [base](base/)).

After that a branch and a label will be created for that language. All future PR must be merged to the language branch until it fully translates the [Reference Fork](https://github.com/fcevado/guide.elm-lang.org).

## Existing translations

* Create a issue name it informing the language, full file path and the section. The issue will always be assigned to it's creator unless commented otherwise.

* Create a PR for the language branch, name it the same way that the issue is named.

* PR will be merged only after approved by the language responsable.

* Ask for help(if needed) in the issue opened.

* Comment on issues without assignee asking to be assigned to it.


## General Guidelines

* Discussions(issues and PR) must always be in english.

* If you give up, please open a WIP PR and comment on the issue that you stopped translating it.

* Please follow the original text structure(keep the same markdown).

* After updating the [Reference Fork](https://github.com/fcevado/guide.elm-lang.org), issues will be created to update the old content.

* Found an error? Open a issue following the naming pattern above and explaining the error.
